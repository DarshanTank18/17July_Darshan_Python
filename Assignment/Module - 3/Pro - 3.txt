Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
--> append ()
-> adds a single element at the end of the list.
-> Accept a single element as an argument.
-> Syntax : list_name.append(element)
-> Modifies the original list in place.

--> extend ()
-> add multiple elements (from an iterable)  to the end of the list.
-> Accept an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) as an argument. 
-> Syntax : list_name.extend(iterable)
-> Modifies the original list in place.
